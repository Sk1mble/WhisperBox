# WhisperBox
A small module for Foundry VTT that adds the ability to create a dedicated box for whispering to a specific player.
When enabled, the module adds an option to the player context menu to launch a Whisperbox with them.
When clicked, this launches a dedicated whisper window for that user, and provides a history of all whispers in the chatlog between the user and that player.
You can also launch by right clicking on an owned token and clicking the spy icon on the bottom left.
There's also a setting to launch whisperbox automatically when you receive a whisper.

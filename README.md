# WhisperBox
A small module for Foundry VTT that adds the ability to create a dedicated box for whispering to a specific player.
When enabled, the module adds an option to the player context menu to launch a Whisperbox with them.
When clicked, this launches a dedicated whisper window for that user, and provides a history of all whispers in the chatlog between the user and that player.
